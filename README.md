Webpage for Recipes (Odin Project)
# My first Website for Odin Project
In this project I will create a website for Recipes. I will need to use my knowledge accquired on HTML, as well as try to merge everything correctly to the repo on GitHub. Wish me luck, because I'm dumb.

# I've created the Recipe Website
Creating the website was very simple actually. I only had to go through a few of the previous lessons but everything worked on the first try! The most boring part was actually loading the content (I think that will be normal in every website so I'm okay with it).
Right now the website is just the Index with 3 different recipes linked to it.
